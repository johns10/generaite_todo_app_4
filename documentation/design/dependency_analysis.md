Required for: End-users

Optimal Implementation Order
Based on the dependencies identified, here's a suggested optimal order for implementing components:

Configuration Management
Database Setup
Sea-ORM Setup
Core Models
Value Objects
Repositories
Error Handling
Logging & Monitoring
Domain Events
Services
Use Cases
DTOs
API Routes
Authentication & Authorization
Middleware
API Handlers
Askama Templates
Unit Tests (ongoing, as components are implemented)
Integration Tests
API Tests
API Documentation
User Documentation

This order ensures that each component has its dependencies in place before implementation, allowing for a smooth development process.
