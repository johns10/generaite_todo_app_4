# Improved To-Do App Architecture

## 1. Layer Overview

1. Presentation Layer: Axum handlers and Askama templates
2. Application Layer: Business logic and use cases
3. Domain Layer: Core business entities and rules
4. Infrastructure Layer: Database interactions (Sea-ORM) and external services
5. Cross-Cutting Concerns: Aspects that affect the entire application

## 2. Component Details

### 2.1 Presentation Layer
- Routes: Define API endpoints
- Handlers: Handle HTTP requests, invoke services, return responses
- Templates: Askama HTML templates for server-side rendering
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Structures for API request/response data

### 2.2 Application Layer
- Services: Implement business logic, orchestrate operations
- Use Cases: Encapsulate and name specific business operations
- Validators: Ensure data integrity before processing

### 2.3 Domain Layer
- Models: Define core business entities and their behaviors
- Value Objects: Represent concepts with no identity
- Domain Events: Represent important occurrences within the domain
- Domain Services: Encapsulate domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity

### 2.4 Infrastructure Layer
- Repositories: Implement data access using Sea-ORM
- Database Migrations: Manage database schema changes
- External Service Clients: Interact with external APIs or services
- Caching: Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance

### 2.5 Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Authentication & Authorization: Implement security measures
- Logging & Monitoring: Track application behavior and performance
- Error Handling: Manage and report errors consistently
- Configuration Management: Handle application settings
- Middleware: Implement cross-cutting logic for HTTP requests/responses

## 3. Data Flow

1. HTTP Request → Routes → Middleware → Handlers
2. Handlers → DTOs → Validators → Services
3. Services → Domain Models / Value Objects
4. Services → Repositories
5. Repositories ↔ Database
6. Services → Handlers
7. Handlers → Templates (for HTML responses) or DTOs (for API responses)
8. Middleware → HTTP Response

## 4. Key Components

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Use middleware for authorization checks
- Integrate with Axum's authentication features

### 4.2 Error Handling
- Define custom error types for each layer
- Implement consistent error mapping to HTTP responses
- Use Rust's `Result` type for robust error handling

### 4.3 Logging & Monitoring
- Utilize the `tracing` crate for structured logging
- Implement request ID tracking for correlating logs
- Set up metrics collection (e.g., using `prometheus`)

### 4.4 Configuration Management
- Use TOML configuration files for different environments (default, development, test, production)
- Implement an `AppConfig` struct to hold configuration values
- Use the `config` crate to manage configuration and environment variables
- Store sensitive information in environment variables

### 4.5 Database Connection
- Use SeaORM for database interactions
- Implement a global database connection instance using `once_cell`
- Configure connection pooling with appropriate settings
- Implement connection timeout and retry logic

### 4.6 Middleware
- Implement custom middleware for common operations (e.g., request timing, CORS)
- Utilize Axum's built-in middleware where appropriate

## 9. Environment Setup

To set up the application for different environments:

1. Create appropriate configuration files in the `config/` directory (default.toml, development.toml, test.toml, production.toml).
2. Set the `RUN_MODE` environment variable to specify the environment (e.g., `development`, `test`, `production`).
3. Use environment variables prefixed with `APP_` to override configuration values (e.g., `APP_DATABASE__URL` to set the database URL).
4. Ensure sensitive information like database passwords are set using environment variables and not committed to version control.

Example of setting up for development:

```bash
export RUN_MODE=development
export APP_DATABASE__URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/todo_app_dev
cargo run
```

For production, ensure all necessary environment variables are set in your deployment environment.

## 5. Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests: Test individual components in isolation
- Integration Tests: Test interactions between components
- API Tests: Test the HTTP endpoints
- Property-Based Tests: Use `proptest` for generating test cases
- Mocking: Use `mockall` for creating mock objects in tests

## 6. Performance Considerations

- Implement database query optimization techniques
- Use asynchronous programming with Tokio
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider using connection pooling for database connections

## 7. Scalability

- Design for horizontal scalability
- Use stateless services where possible
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Consider using message queues for background processing

## 8. Security

- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper password hashing (e.g., using `argon2`)
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

This improved architecture provides a more detailed and structured approach to building your To-Do application. It emphasizes clear separation of concerns, scalability, and incorporates best practices for Rust web development.
