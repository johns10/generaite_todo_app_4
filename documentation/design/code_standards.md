# Code Standards for To-Do Application

## 1. Rust-Specific Best Practices
- Follow the Rust API Guidelines (https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Prefer using `Result` and `Option` types over exceptions or null values
- Utilize Rust's ownership system and borrow checker for memory safety
- Use `match` expressions for exhaustive pattern matching
- Leverage Rust's powerful macro system for code generation when appropriate

## 2. High Modularity and Code Organization
- Use Rust's module system (`mod` keyword) to organize code logically
- Create a clear separation between public and private APIs using `pub` keyword judiciously
- Utilize the `use` keyword to bring items into scope, preferring explicit imports
- Implement the fa√ßade pattern using `pub use` to re-export internal items

## 3. Strict Segregation of Responsibility
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Use Rust's trait system to define clear interfaces between components
- Implement the Repository pattern for data access and Service pattern for business logic

## 4. File Structure and Size
- Aim for files no larger than 200-300 lines of code
- Use Rust's module system to split large files into smaller, focused modules
- Each file should generally contain one primary struct or enum and its implementations

## 5. Type System and Generics
- Leverage Rust's strong type system to prevent errors at compile-time
- Use generics and associated types in traits for flexible, reusable code
- Implement the `From` and `Into` traits for type conversions
- Use `PhantomData` for type-level programming when necessary

## 6. Error Handling
- Define custom error types using the `thiserror` crate
- Use the `?` operator for concise error propagation
- Implement the `std::error::Error` trait for all error types
- Use `anyhow::Result` for functions that can produce multiple error types

## 7. Asynchronous Programming
- Use `async`/`.await` syntax for asynchronous code
- Prefer `tokio` for the runtime and `futures` for utility traits
- Use `Stream` trait for asynchronous iteration

## 8. Testing
- Write unit tests using the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute and `#[test]` macro
- Implement integration tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use `proptest` for property-based testing
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage, measured with tools like `tarpaulin`

## 9. Documentation
- Use `///` for documenting items and `//!` for module-level documentation
- Include examples in documentation using `# Examples` sections
- Run `cargo doc` regularly to ensure all public items are documented
- Use `rustdoc` attributes like `#[must_use]` and `#[deprecated]` where appropriate

## 10. Naming Conventions
- Follow Rust's standard naming conventions:
  - `snake_case` for functions, methods, variables, modules, and file names
  - `PascalCase` for types (structs, enums, traits)
  - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants and static variables
- Use descriptive, meaningful names that convey purpose

## 11. Performance Considerations
- Use `#[derive(Debug)]` for quick debug output, but implement `fmt::Display` for user-facing output
- Prefer stack allocation over heap allocation where possible
- Use `Vec` and `String` instead of fixed-size arrays or `&str` for growing collections

## 12. Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up-to-date, regularly running `cargo update`
- Minimize the number of dependencies to reduce compilation time and potential vulnerabilities
- Use `cargo-audit` to check for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## 13. Tooling
- Use `rustfmt` to maintain consistent code formatting
- Employ `clippy` as a linter to catch common mistakes and non-idiomatic code
- Integrate these tools into the CI/CD pipeline

## 14. Configuration Management
- Use the `config` crate for managing configuration
- Store configuration in TOML or YAML format
- Use environment variables for sensitive information, leveraging the `dotenv` crate if necessary

## 15. Continuous Integration and Deployment
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Run tests, linting, and formatting checks on every push
- Automate the deployment process

These improved standards incorporate Rust-specific best practices and align with your documentation plan. They provide a solid foundation for developing a high-quality, maintainable Rust application.
