# Integrated Rust Test Strategy

## 1. Overview

This strategy outlines an automated testing approach for validating changes made by the Aider AI coding assistant before committing them to the codebase. It integrates Cargo-watch for continuous monitoring and Rust's built-in testing framework for comprehensive test coverage.

## 2. Components

- Aider for AI-assisted code generation and modification
- Cargo-watch for file system monitoring
- Rust's built-in testing framework
- Testing Pipeline (Unit Tests, Integration Tests)
- Version Control Integration
- Reporting and Logging

## 3. Workflow

1. Developer initiates Aider session
2. Aider generates or modifies code based on prompts
3. Cargo-watch detects changes
4. Testing Pipeline is triggered
5. If tests pass, changes are ready for review and commit
6. If tests fail, developer is notified to make corrections

## 4. Detailed Strategy

### 4.1 Aider Setup

- Install Aider: `pip install aider-chat`
- Configure Aider to work with your project directory
- Use Aider's chat interface for code generation and modification

### 4.2 Cargo-watch Setup

- Install cargo-watch: `cargo install cargo-watch`
- Run cargo-watch to monitor project directory:
  ```
  cargo watch -x check -x test -x 'run --bin test_runner'
  ```

### 4.3 Testing Pipeline

#### 4.3.1 Static Analysis

- Run clippy for linting
- Check code formatting with rustfmt

#### 4.3.2 Unit Tests

- Location: In the same file as the code being tested
- Structure: 
  ```rust
  #[cfg(test)]
  mod tests {
      use super::*;

      #[test]
      fn test_function_name() {
          // Test code here
      }
  }
  ```
- Run all unit tests with `cargo test`
- Can test private functions

#### 4.3.3 Integration Tests

- Location: In the `tests` directory at the root of the project
- Structure: Each file in `tests` is its own crate
- Example:
  ```rust
  // tests/integration_test.rs
  use your_crate_name;

  #[test]
  fn test_external_functionality() {
      // Test code here
  }
  ```
- Run integration tests with `cargo test`
- Only test the public API

#### 4.3.4 Custom Test Runner

- Implement a custom binary `test_runner` for additional tests or checks
- Can include performance tests, end-to-end tests, or other custom validations

### 4.4 Test Organization

- Use `#[cfg(test)]` to compile test code only when running tests
- Utilize the `tests` module in each file for unit tests
- Create separate files in the `tests` directory for integration tests
- Use `mod common` in `tests/common/mod.rs` for shared test setup code

### 4.5 Best Practices

1. Write tests for both success and failure cases
2. Use descriptive test function names
3. Utilize `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, and `assert_ne!` macros
4. Group related tests using nested `mod` blocks
5. Use `#[should_panic]` for tests that should fail
6. Implement `Debug` trait for custom types used in tests

### 4.6 Running Tests

- Run all tests: `cargo test`
- Run tests with output: `cargo test -- --nocapture`
- Run a specific test: `cargo test test_function_name`
- Run tests in a specific integration test file: `cargo test --test integration_test_file_name`

## 5. Version Control Integration

- Use Git hooks to run tests before commits
- Configure CI/CD pipeline to run full test suite on push

## 6. Reporting and Logging

- Generate test coverage reports using tools like tarpaulin
- Log test results and coverage metrics
- Alert developers on test failures

This integrated strategy combines the power of AI-assisted coding with Rust's robust testing framework, ensuring high code quality and reliability throughout the development process.
